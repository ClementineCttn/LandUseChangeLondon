The site was originally allocated for 300 units in the Local Plan but this yield has been significantly reduced in light of the Cabinet resolution in June 2010 which resolved that the part of the site which is former allotment land would be developed for housing and open space while the Vyne Road car park was not available. In addition, the part of the site owned by Network Rail is not considered to be currently available for development. As a result, a reduced approximate yield of 50 units on the council and Sentinel owned part of the site is considered suitable for land supply purposes. Given the limited infrastructure needed to deliver the available part of the site it is predicted that completions would begin in 2013/14.  There is no legal, physical or commercial reason why the site should not be delivered within a 5 year timescale.The site is considered to be suitable for development, being an allocation in the adopted Local Plan. It also has a completed development brief. A  planning application for  313 units was refused at Development Control Committee in July 2008. The site remains available for development (owned by Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council) and commencement of development within the next five years remains achievable given the characteristics of the site. However, due to the delays in the site coming forward and the fact that the site is currently not being actively marketed (although offers would be considered), predicted first completions have been pushed back to 2015/16. Until further information is available, the Adopted Local Plan figure of 300 units is used as an indicative yield for land supply purposes.
